# StringOperations

## Introduction

In this lab you will apply methods from the String class to manipulate String type variables.  Additionally, you will print an interesting image to the console.  

Both of the these challenges should be completed in a single driver class. 

## Code Challenge 1

- [ ] Your task is to write a word scrambler program.  Your scrambled word program should extract the first letter of a word and the last letter of a word.  The scrambled word should have the last letter printed first, the first letter printed last, and everything else in the middle.  Consider the following words.   

	* Popcorn
	* Picture
	* Computer

After your program is run, they should look as follows when printed to the console, 

	* nopcorp
	* eicturp
	* romputec

## Code Challenge 2

- [ ] Below are pictures of ASCII art.  Select one you would like to create. 

	* [asciiArt1.jpg](asciiArt1.jpg)
	* [asciiArt2.jpg](asciiArt2.jpg)
	* [asciiArt3.jpg](asciiArt3.jpg)
	* [asciiArt4.jpg](asciiArt4.jpg)
	* [asciiArt5.jpg](asciiArt5.jpg)

- [ ] Write code that prints the ASCII art exactly as shown. Doing so will require you to escape many of the characters in the picture.  For an extra challenge, try to get the ASCII art to print exactly as shown using a single print statement. 

- [ ] At the top of the file, before your class declaration use comments to indicate the following 
on separate lines

	* Your name
	* Course
	* Date

- [ ] Inside the main method of your program use block quotes to write a comments which indicate challenge 1 and challenge 2, along with a description about what each of these challenges accomplish. 

- [ ] Once you have completed the above be sure to push your changes to GitHub
